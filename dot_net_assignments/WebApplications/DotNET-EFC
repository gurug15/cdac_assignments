[Bind("","","")]  --> to limit the no of preperties to bind
 -- the non binded properties must have nullabe ? so that it doesn't give exception/ModelState.valid

______________CREATE____________
//below both are valid but Employee is faster one
_context.Add(employee);
_context.Employee.Add(employee);



_context.SaveChanges();
await _context.SaveChangesAsync(); // go make changes in the database -> non blocking


_______________EDIT_____________
//same as create 
	- _context.Update(emp);
	-  _context.Employee.Update(emp); --> better option as it doesnt go through every collection

_______________DELETE_____________

	- _context.Remove();
			or
	- context.Employee.Remove();
	-- there are two delete methods one get and one post
		- get has Delete(int? id) 
		- post has DeleteConfirmed/*can be whatever but need to add attribute*/(int id);
			- cant be same name cause cant overload with same name and same signature 
			- so we use attribute [HttpPost, ActionName("Delete")]
			-
